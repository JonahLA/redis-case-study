# Feature: Checkout Process API

## Overview
This feature implements API endpoints to simulate the checkout process in an e-commerce application, allowing users to submit their shopping cart for order processing.

## User Story
As an online shopper, I want to proceed through a checkout process with my selected bowling balls, so that I can complete my purchase and receive confirmation of my order.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Creating a new order from cart contents
Given I have items in my shopping cart
When I send a POST request to `/api/checkout` with shipping and payment details
Then I should receive a 201 status code
And an order should be created in the system
And the response should contain order confirmation details
And the order status should be set to "pending"

### Scenario 2: Checkout with empty cart
Given I have an empty shopping cart
When I send a POST request to `/api/checkout`
Then I should receive a 400 status code
And the response should explain that the cart cannot be empty

### Scenario 3: Checkout with insufficient product stock
Given I have items in my cart
And one of the products is now out of stock
When I send a POST request to `/api/checkout`
Then I should receive a 400 status code
And the response should identify which products are no longer available
And suggest removing or updating those items

### Scenario 4: Retrieving order status
Given I have created an order
When I send a GET request to `/api/orders/:orderId`
Then I should receive a 200 status code
And the response should contain the current order status and details

### Scenario 5: Simulating order completion
Given I have a pending order
When I send a PATCH request to `/api/orders/:orderId/complete` (for simulation purposes)
Then I should receive a 200 status code
And the order status should be updated to "completed"
And inventory should be updated to reflect the purchased items

## Technical Implementation
- Create an OrderController with endpoints for:
  - POST /api/checkout
  - GET /api/orders
  - GET /api/orders/:id
  - PATCH /api/orders/:id/complete (for simulation)
- Implement an OrderService that handles the business logic
- Create new database models for Order and OrderItem
- Implement transaction-based processing to ensure data consistency
- Add validation for required order details (shipping address, etc.)
- Implement stock verification before completing orders
- Create proper error handling for various checkout scenarios
- Implement order status flow (pending â†’ completed)
