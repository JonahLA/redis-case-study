# Ticket: PostgreSQL and Prisma Database Integration

## Description
This ticket focuses on integrating PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM into our backend application to handle data persistence. Building on the containerized environment set up in the previous ticket, we'll configure the PostgreSQL database connection, set up Prisma as our ORM, define product and category models, and implement database operations. This integration will:
- Configure Prisma to connect to our PostgreSQL database container
- Define the data schema for our e-commerce application
- Create migration scripts for database setup and schema changes
- Implement repository pattern for database operations
- Add proper error handling and connection validation

This implementation will provide a solid data layer foundation for our e-commerce product catalog.

## Tests
The following tests will verify the implementation:
1. **Automated Tests**:
   - Unit tests to verify Prisma client initialization and connection
   - Integration tests to ensure CRUD operations work as expected for product and category models
   - Test migrations to confirm they apply correctly and maintain data integrity
   - Validation tests to ensure data constraints are properly enforced

2. **Manual Tests**:
   - Verify database connection from the application container
   - Confirm that migrations can be run successfully
   - Check that seed data is correctly inserted into the database
   - Validate that database operations can be performed through the Prisma client

## Implementation Steps
1. **Install Prisma Dependencies**:
   - Install Prisma CLI and client: `npm install prisma @prisma/client --save`
   - Install dev dependencies for testing: `npm install @types/pg --save-dev`
   - Initialize Prisma in the project: `npx prisma init`

2. **Configure Prisma for PostgreSQL**:
   - Update the generated `prisma/schema.prisma` file to use PostgreSQL
   - Configure the database connection URL in the schema file to use environment variables
   - Update `.env` and `.env.example` files with the PostgreSQL connection string that points to the containerized database
   - Ensure Prisma can access the database from inside the container

3. **Define Database Schema Models**:
   - Create the following models in the Prisma schema:
     - `Product` (id, name, description, price, stock, imageUrl, createdAt, updatedAt)
     - `Category` (id, name, description, createdAt, updatedAt)
     - `Brand` (id, name, description, imageUrl, createdAt, updatedAt)
   - Define relationships between models (products belong to categories and brands)
   - Add appropriate indices and constraints (unique names, required fields, etc.)

4. **Create Database Migrations**:
   - Generate initial migration files: `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`
   - Create a script in `package.json` for running migrations
   - Document the migration process for both development and production environments
   - Create a seed script to populate the database with initial test data

5. **Implement Prisma Client Integration**:
   - Create a `src/lib/prisma.ts` file to initialize and export the Prisma client
   - Implement singleton pattern to prevent multiple client instances
   - Add proper error handling for connection issues
   - Configure connection pooling for optimal performance

6. **Create Repository Layer**:
   - Create repository classes for each model (ProductRepository, CategoryRepository, BrandRepository)
   - Implement standard CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Add specialized query methods for business requirements (e.g., findProductsByCategory)
   - Ensure proper error handling and typing for all database operations

7. **Integrate with Existing Application**:
   - Update service layer to use the repository classes
   - Modify the Express application to handle database connection lifecycle
   - Implement graceful shutdown to properly close database connections
   - Add database health check to the existing health endpoint

8. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Create a test database configuration for automated tests
   - Write integration tests for repository methods
   - Create a script to set up and tear down test database for CI/CD
   - Update Docker test configuration to support database testing

9. **Documentation**:
   - Update README.md with database-specific instructions
   - Document the schema design and relationships
   - Provide examples of common database operations
   - Add troubleshooting information for database connectivity issues

10. **Run and Verify**:
    - Execute migrations against the containerized database
    - Run the seed script to populate test data
    - Test database operations through the API
    - Verify that all tests pass in the containerized environment
