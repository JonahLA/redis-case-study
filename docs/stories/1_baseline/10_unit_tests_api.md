# Feature: Unit Tests for API Endpoints

## Overview
This feature focuses on implementing comprehensive unit tests for all API endpoints in our e-commerce application. While some tests already exist, this ticket will ensure complete coverage of all services and controllers to verify proper functionality of the API.

## User Story
As a developer, I want to have thorough unit tests for all API endpoints, so that I can ensure the application behaves correctly and detect any regressions early in the development process.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Complete Service Layer Tests
Given the application has service classes that implement business logic
When I run the test suite
Then all service methods should be tested for normal operation and error conditions
And the test coverage for service layer should be at least 80%

### Scenario 2: Complete Controller Layer Tests
Given the application has controllers that handle HTTP requests
When I run the test suite
Then all API endpoints should have corresponding tests
And both successful operations and error conditions should be tested
And the test coverage for controller layer should be at least 80%

### Scenario 3: Integration Tests for Key Workflows
Given the application supports key workflows like browsing products and checkout
When I run the integration tests
Then these workflows should be verified end-to-end
And the tests should validate both successful execution and proper error handling

## Technical Implementation
Based on analysis of the existing tests and the codebase, the following tests need to be implemented:

1. **Service Layer Tests**:
   - Complete `CartService` unit tests
   - Complete `BrandService` unit tests
   - Complete `CategoryService` unit tests
   - Add `OrderService` unit tests
   - Add `InventoryService` unit tests
   - Add `HealthService` unit tests

2. **Controller Layer Tests**:
   - Add `ProductController` unit tests
   - Add `CartController` unit tests
   - Add `BrandController` unit tests
   - Add `CategoryController` unit tests
   - Add `OrderController` unit tests
   - Add `InventoryController` unit tests
   - Add `HealthController` unit tests

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Complete cart workflow tests (add, update, remove items)
   - Add checkout process tests
   - Add inventory management tests

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set up Testing Foundation
- Review and refine the existing test utilities
- Set up mocking patterns for consistent test implementation
- Configure any additional testing tools or plugins needed

### 2. Service Layer Tests

#### CartService Tests
- Test `getCart` method (new cart and existing cart)
- Test `addItemToCart` method (new item and updating existing item)
- Test `updateCartItemQuantity` method
- Test `removeItemFromCart` method
- Test `clearCart` method
- Test error conditions (product not found, insufficient stock)

#### BrandService Tests
- Test `getAllBrands` method
- Test `getBrandById` method (valid ID and invalid ID)
- Test `getProductsByBrand` method with various pagination and sorting options
- Test error conditions (brand not found)

#### CategoryService Tests
- Test `getAllCategories` method
- Test `getCategoryById` method (valid ID and invalid ID)
- Test `getProductsByCategory` method with various pagination and sorting options
- Test error conditions (category not found)

#### OrderService Tests
- Test `createOrder` method with valid cart and address
- Test `getOrdersByUser` method
- Test `getOrderById` method (valid ID and invalid ID)
- Test `completeOrder` method
- Test error conditions (empty cart, out of stock, authorization)

#### InventoryService Tests
- Test `getInventory` method
- Test `adjustInventory` method for positive and negative adjustments
- Test `getInventoryAuditHistory` method
- Test `adjustInventoryBatch` method
- Test error conditions (product not found, negative stock)

#### HealthService Tests
- Test `getHealthStatus` method with both services healthy
- Test `getHealthStatus` method with database issues
- Test `getHealthStatus` method with Redis issues

### 3. Controller Layer Tests

#### ProductController Tests
- Test `GET /api/products` endpoint
- Test `GET /api/products/:productId` endpoint (valid and invalid IDs)
- Test error handling and edge cases

#### CartController Tests
- Test `GET /api/cart` endpoint
- Test `POST /api/cart/items` endpoint with valid and invalid data
- Test `PATCH /api/cart/items/:productId` endpoint
- Test `DELETE /api/cart/items/:productId` endpoint
- Test `DELETE /api/cart` endpoint
- Test validation failures and error responses

#### BrandController Tests
- Test `GET /api/brands` endpoint
- Test `GET /api/brands/:brandId` endpoint
- Test `GET /api/brands/:brandId/products` endpoint with various query parameters
- Test error handling for invalid parameters

#### CategoryController Tests
- Test `GET /api/categories` endpoint
- Test `GET /api/categories/:categoryId` endpoint
- Test `GET /api/categories/:categoryId/products` endpoint with various query parameters
- Test error handling for invalid parameters

#### OrderController Tests
- Test `POST /api/checkout` endpoint with valid and invalid data
- Test `GET /api/orders` endpoint
- Test `GET /api/orders/:orderId` endpoint
- Test `PATCH /api/orders/:orderId/complete` endpoint
- Test authorization and validation checks

#### InventoryController Tests
- Test `PATCH /api/inventory/:productId/adjust` endpoint
- Test `GET /api/inventory/:productId` endpoint
- Test `GET /api/inventory/:productId/audit` endpoint
- Test parameter validation and error handling

#### HealthController Tests
- Test `GET /health` endpoint with services up
- Test `GET /health` endpoint with services down

### 4. Integration Tests
- Implement tests for adding products to cart, updating quantities, and removing items
- Implement tests for the checkout process from cart submission to order completion
- Implement tests for inventory adjustments and their effects on product availability

## Tests
The following tests will verify the implementation:

1. **Automated Tests**:
   - Run the comprehensive test suite to ensure at least 80% coverage of services and controllers
   - Verify that all defined API endpoints have corresponding tests
   - Check that both success paths and error conditions are tested

2. **Manual Testing**:
   - Review test reports to ensure all critical workflows are covered
   - Verify that tests properly mock external dependencies
   - Confirm that test assertions verify both response status and response body content

## Considerations
- Use dependency injection patterns to make services more testable
- Use consistent mocking approaches across all tests
- Focus on testing business logic thoroughly in service tests
- Focus on request/response handling and validation in controller tests
- Document any testing patterns or utilities created for future reference
