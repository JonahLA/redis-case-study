# Feature: Redis Caching Infrastructure Configuration

## Overview
This feature focuses on integrating Redis as a caching layer into our e-commerce application, establishing the foundation for implementing advanced caching patterns in future iterations.

## User Story
As a developer, I want to set up Redis as a caching infrastructure, so that I can leverage caching capabilities to improve application performance for high-traffic scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Redis Service Configuration
Given the application is running in a containerized environment
When I deploy the application with Docker Compose
Then a Redis service should be available and properly connected to the main application
And the Redis service should persist data between container restarts

### Scenario 2: Redis Client Integration
Given I have the application codebase
When I need to interact with Redis from my application code
Then I should have access to a properly configured Redis client
And the client should handle connection errors gracefully
And the client should be implemented as a singleton to prevent connection leaks

### Scenario 3: Redis Connection Health Check
Given the application is running
When I access the application health endpoint
Then it should include Redis connection status
And report appropriate error information if Redis is unavailable

### Scenario 4: Redis Monitoring
Given Redis is configured and running
When I need to monitor Redis performance and operations
Then I should have access to a monitoring tool
And the tool should provide visibility into cache operations and memory usage

## Technical Implementation
- Containerize Redis with Docker and add to the existing Docker Compose setup
- Implement Redis client using ioredis with proper TypeScript integration
- Create a Redis connection singleton with error handling and reconnection logic
- Add Redis admin/monitoring tool (Redis Commander or Redis Insight)
- Create helper utilities for common Redis operations
- Develop tests to validate Redis functionality

### API Contract (if applicable)
```typescript
// Redis Client Interface
interface RedisService {
  // Basic operations
  set(key: string, value: string, options?: SetOptions): Promise<string>;
  get(key: string): Promise<string | null>;
  del(key: string | string[]): Promise<number>;
  
  // Hash operations
  hset(key: string, field: string, value: string): Promise<number>;
  hget(key: string, field: string): Promise<string | null>;
  hgetall(key: string): Promise<Record<string, string>>;
  
  // Connection management
  isConnected(): boolean;
  closeConnection(): Promise<void>;
  
  // Cache utilities
  setWithExpiry(key: string, value: string, ttlSeconds: number): Promise<string>;
  getOrSet(key: string, fetchFn: () => Promise<string>, ttlSeconds: number): Promise<string>;
}
```

## Tests
The following tests will verify the implementation:

1. **Automated Tests**:
   - Unit tests for RedisService wrapper functionality
   - Integration tests verifying Redis connection and basic operations
   - Tests for error handling and reconnection logic
   - Tests for cache helper utilities
   - Load tests measuring basic set/get performance

2. **Manual Tests**:
   - Verify Redis container starts correctly with Docker Compose
   - Confirm persistence configuration works by stopping/starting containers
   - Validate monitoring tool access and functionality
   - Check that Redis connection information appears in health checks

## Implementation Steps

1. **Update Docker Compose Configuration**:
   - Add Redis service to the Docker Compose file
   - Configure persistence volume for Redis data
   - Set appropriate network configuration to allow application container to access Redis
   - Configure Redis password for basic security
   - Map Redis port for external access during development

2. **Install Redis Dependencies**:
   - Install ioredis package: `npm install ioredis --save`
   - Install types: `npm install @types/ioredis --save-dev`
   - Add testing utilities as needed

3. **Implement Redis Connection Service**:
   - Create `src/lib/redis.ts` as a singleton service
   - Implement connection with proper error handling and reconnection logic
   - Add TypeScript interfaces for Redis operations
   - Configure connection options using environment variables
   - Implement clean shutdown procedure

4. **Create Redis Utility Helpers**:
   - Implement common cache operations (get, set, delete)
   - Add helper methods for working with hash structures
   - Create utility for cache operations with automatic expiration
   - Implement pattern for cache miss handling with data fetching

5. **Configure Redis Monitoring**:
   - Add Redis Commander or RedisInsight to Docker Compose
   - Configure authentication and access restrictions
   - Document how to access and use the monitoring tools
   - Set up basic dashboard configuration

6. **Implement Health Check Integration**:
   - Extend the existing health check endpoint to include Redis status
   - Add connection metrics and basic statistics
   - Implement proper error reporting for Redis connection issues

7. **Test Redis Functionality**:
   - Create unit tests for Redis service methods
   - Implement integration tests using a test Redis instance
   - Add test utilities for Redis mocking where appropriate
   - Document testing patterns for Redis in the codebase

8. **Update Environment Configuration**:
   - Add Redis-specific environment variables to .env and .env.example files
   - Update README with Redis configuration information
   - Document Redis connection parameters and security considerations

9. **Create Sample Implementation**:
   - Implement a simple caching example for product retrieval
   - Add basic cache hit/miss logging
   - Create a utility to clear the cache during development
   - Document the example cache implementation

10. **Documentation**:
    - Update project README with Redis integration details
    - Document Redis service architecture and design decisions
    - Create usage examples for common Redis operations
    - Add troubleshooting section for common Redis issues
