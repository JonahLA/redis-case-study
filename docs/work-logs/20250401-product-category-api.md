# Product Category API Implementation

## Decisions Made:
1. **API Structure**:
   - Created separate services and controllers for categories and brands
   - Implemented consistent RESTful endpoints for all resources
   - Used a shared pagination response interface to ensure consistency across APIs
   - Structured endpoints to follow resource hierarchy (e.g., `/categories/:id/products`)

2. **Pagination and Sorting**:
   - Implemented pagination with limit and offset parameters
   - Added sorting capabilities by product name and price
   - Applied consistent query parameter validation
   - Used default values (limit: 10, offset: 0, sort: name, order: asc) when parameters aren't specified

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Leveraged the existing AppError class for consistent error responses
   - Added specific error messages for common validation issues
   - Implemented proper 404 handling for non-existent resources
   - Used middleware for centralized error handling

4. **Data Models and Repository**:
   - Built on existing repository classes rather than creating new ones
   - Extended the repository patterns with relation-based queries
   - Used TypeScript types from Prisma for better type safety
   - Implemented in-memory sorting for consistent behavior

5. **TypeScript Type Safety**:
   - Used explicit type casting with Prisma's relation types
   - Added proper type definitions for service method parameters and responses
   - Implemented proper type checking for query parameters
   - Used TypeScript interfaces to define shared data structures

## Technical Details:
- Created CategoryService and BrandService classes to encapsulate business logic
- Implemented controllers that handle HTTP requests and delegate to services
- Added proper parameter validation for all API endpoints
- Used TypeScript interfaces for structured response objects
- Created integration tests with mocked service dependencies
- Added proper status codes for different scenarios (200 for success, 400 for bad requests, 404 for not found)
- Implemented sorting mechanism that handles both string and numeric fields

## Implementation Challenges:
1. **Pagination Implementation**:
   - Solution: Created a generic PaginatedResponse interface to standardize pagination across APIs
   - Applied consistent pagination logic with hasMore flag to help clients determine if more results are available

2. **Type Safety with Prisma**:
   - Solution: Leveraged Prisma's generated types for proper type checking
   - Used specific Prisma payload types with explicit includes for better TypeScript integration
   - Applied type assertions to properly handle relations in the TypeScript compiler

3. **Query Parameter Validation**:
   - Solution: Implemented comprehensive validation for all query parameters
   - Added specific error messages to guide API consumers when they provide invalid parameters
   - Used type assertion to ensure TypeScript type safety

4. **TypeScript Compiler Errors with Prisma Relations**:
   - Issue: TypeScript couldn't infer that objects returned from repository methods with relations included would have the relation properties
   - Solution: Used explicit type assertions with Prisma's generated types:
     ```typescript
     const categoryWithProducts = await repository.findByIdWithProducts(id) as 
       Prisma.CategoryGetPayload<{ include: { products: true } }>;
     ```
   - Added additional null checks to handle empty relations
   - Implemented more robust error handling for relation queries
