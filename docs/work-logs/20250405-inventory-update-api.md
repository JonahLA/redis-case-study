# Inventory Update API Implementation

## Date
April 5, 2025

## Overview
Today I implemented the Inventory Update API, enabling accurate tracking of product stock levels and providing endpoints for both automated and manual inventory adjustments. This implementation follows the baseline approach without Redis integration, establishing performance metrics for future comparison.

## Decisions Made

### 1. Inventory Management Structure
- **Decision**: Created dedicated inventory controllers and services separate from product management.
- **Rationale**: Separation of concerns provides clearer API boundaries and more focused responsibility.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Implemented `InventoryController` with dedicated endpoints for inventory operations
  - Created `InventoryService` with proper domain logic for inventory management
  - Enhanced `ProductRepository` with specialized inventory query methods

### 2. Audit Trail Implementation
- **Decision**: Created a comprehensive audit system for inventory changes.
- **Rationale**: Provides accountability, traceability, and historical records of all stock movements.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added `InventoryAudit` model to Prisma schema
  - Implemented `InventoryAuditRepository` for audit-related data access
  - Recorded detailed information including previous stock, new stock, adjustment amount, and reason
  - Integrated audit logging into all inventory modification operations

### 3. Transaction-based Stock Updates
- **Decision**: Implemented all inventory updates within database transactions.
- **Rationale**: Ensures data consistency and prevents partial updates in complex operations.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Used Prisma's transaction API for atomic inventory operations
  - Implemented batch adjustment capabilities for multi-product updates
  - Added validation prior to transaction execution to fail early when appropriate
  - Created optimized query patterns to reduce database load

### 4. Stock Status Classification
- **Decision**: Added a stock status system with three levels: in_stock, low_stock, and out_of_stock.
- **Rationale**: Provides clear inventory status indicators for business operations and UI displays.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Defined configurable threshold for low stock warning (5 units)
  - Included status in API responses for quick reference
  - Implemented helper method to consistently determine status based on quantity

### 5. Concurrency Control
- **Decision**: Implemented pessimistic locking for inventory operations.
- **Rationale**: Prevents race conditions in concurrent inventory updates.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Used database transactions with appropriate isolation level
  - Implemented proper error handling for concurrency failures
  - Added retry logic for failed transactions (with limits)
  - Created specific validation checks to maintain data integrity

### 6. API Design
- **Decision**: Created RESTful endpoints following established patterns.
- **Rationale**: Consistency with existing API patterns improves developer experience.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - `PATCH /api/inventory/:productId/adjust` for inventory adjustments
  - `GET /api/inventory/:productId` for current inventory status
  - `GET /api/inventory/:productId/audit` for retrieving audit history
  - Implemented consistent request/response formats

## API Endpoints Implemented

1. `PATCH /api/inventory/:productId/adjust` - Adjust inventory level with required reason
2. `GET /api/inventory/:productId` - Get current inventory status for a product
3. `GET /api/inventory/:productId/audit` - Retrieve inventory adjustment history

## Implementation Challenges

### 1. Transaction Isolation
- **Challenge**: Ensuring proper isolation level for inventory transactions.
- **Solution**: Used Prisma's transaction API with proper locking strategy and validation.

### 2. Audit Trail Design
- **Challenge**: Determining the right balance of audit information to store.
- **Solution**: Created a dedicated audit model with comprehensive fields while keeping it separate from the product model.

### 3. Batch Operations
- **Challenge**: Maintaining atomicity across multiple product inventory updates.
- **Solution**: Implemented two-phase validation and update process within a single transaction.

### 4. TypeScript Type Safety
- **Challenge**: Ensuring type safety with Prisma models and repositories.
- **Solution**: Created proper type definitions and interfaces for consistent typing across the application.

## Next Steps

1. Collect performance metrics for baseline inventory operations
2. Implement Redis-based caching for frequently accessed inventory data
3. Add real-time inventory notifications using Redis pub/sub
4. Measure performance improvements after Redis integration
5. Document findings and optimization recommendations
