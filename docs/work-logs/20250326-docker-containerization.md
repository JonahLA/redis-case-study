# Docker Containerization Setup

## Decisions Made:
1. **Docker Configuration**:
   - Created a multi-container environment with Docker Compose
   - Set up three services: Node.js application, PostgreSQL, and Redis
   - Used separate Dockerfiles for development and production environments
   - Implemented service health checks to ensure dependencies are ready before the app starts

2. **Technology Choices**:
   - Node.js 18 Alpine as the base image for smaller container size
   - PostgreSQL 14 Alpine for the database
   - Redis 7 Alpine for caching
   - Docker Compose 3.8 for orchestration

3. **Development Workflow**:
   - Configured volume mounts to enable hot-reloading of code changes
   - Set up environment variables through Docker Compose
   - Created a wait-for script to handle service startup dependencies
   - Implemented separate Docker Compose configurations for development and testing

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Used environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Created .env.example with placeholder values
   - Implemented isolated networks for container communication

5. **Data Persistence**:
   - Configured named volumes for PostgreSQL and Redis data
   - Ensured data persists between container restarts
