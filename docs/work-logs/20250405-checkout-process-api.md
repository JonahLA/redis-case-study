# Checkout Process API Implementation

## Date
April 5, 2025

## Overview
Today I implemented the Checkout Process API, which enables users to complete their purchases by transforming their shopping carts into orders. This implementation follows the baseline approach without Redis integration, establishing performance metrics for future comparison with a Redis-enhanced version.

## Decisions Made

### 1. Database Schema Extensions
- **Decision**: Created Order and OrderItem models in the Prisma schema.
- **Rationale**: These models provide the necessary structure for order persistence while maintaining relationships with products.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Used UUID for order IDs to provide better security and distribution
  - Created a one-to-many relationship between Order and OrderItem
  - Stored product details at time of purchase (name, price) to preserve order history even if products change later
  - Added fields for all shipping address components and order status

### 2. Transaction-based Processing
- **Decision**: Implemented all order creation operations within database transactions.
- **Rationale**: Ensures data consistency between order creation, cart clearing, and inventory updates.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Used Prisma's transaction API to create orders and order items atomically
  - Applied proper error handling to roll back transactions on failures
  - Ensured stock validation occurs before transaction begins to prevent avoidable transaction failures

### 3. Stock Validation Strategy
- **Decision**: Implemented two-phase stock validation (pre-order and during completion).
- **Rationale**: Provides both a good user experience (early validation) and data integrity (final validation).
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Initial validation during checkout prevents orders for out-of-stock items
  - Second validation during order completion ensures stock hasn't changed since order creation
  - Added descriptive error messages identifying specific out-of-stock products

### 4. Order Lifecycle Management
- **Decision**: Implemented a simple order status progression from "pending" to "completed".
- **Rationale**: Creates a clear separation between order creation and fulfillment while keeping the simulation straightforward.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Orders start in "pending" status at creation
  - Provided an endpoint to simulate order completion
  - Added validation to prevent invalid status transitions

### 5. Payment Processing Simulation
- **Decision**: Created a simulated payment processing flow.
- **Rationale**: Allows for testing checkout scenarios without integrating actual payment providers.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Implemented a controlled failure mechanism through the `simulatePayment` parameter
  - Added artificial processing delay to simulate real-world conditions
  - Used appropriate error handling for payment failures

### 6. Cart Integration
- **Decision**: Integrated with existing CartService for seamless checkout flow.
- **Rationale**: Maintains separation of concerns while creating a complete purchase flow.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Retrieved cart contents during checkout
  - Cleared cart after successful order creation
  - Used cart's calculated totals as the basis for order values

### 7. Authorization Model
- **Decision**: Implemented user-based security for order access.
- **Rationale**: Ensures users can only access their own orders.
- **Implementation Details**: 
  - Used user ID from request headers to identify the current user
  - Added explicit authorization checks when retrieving or modifying orders
  - Returned appropriate 403 errors for unauthorized access attempts

### 8. API Response Structure
- **Decision**: Created consistent response structures matching the API contract.
- **Rationale**: Provides a predictable interface for frontend integration.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Formatted responses in repository methods to maintain consistent structure
  - Included complete order details in responses
  - Provided appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios (201 for creation, etc.)

## API Endpoints Implemented

1. `POST /api/checkout` - Create a new order from cart contents
2. `GET /api/orders` - List all orders for the current user
3. `GET /api/orders/:orderId` - Get details for a specific order
4. `PATCH /api/orders/:orderId/complete` - Simulate order completion (updates status, adjusts inventory)

## Implementation Challenges

### 1. Order Structure Complexity
- **Challenge**: Determining the right balance of data to store in orders vs. reference from products.
- **Solution**: Stored essential product details in order items while maintaining product references for inventory management.

### 2. Transaction Management
- **Challenge**: Ensuring proper transaction handling for reliable order creation.
- **Solution**: Leveraged Prisma's transaction API to create orders and items in a single atomic operation.

### 3. Stock Management
- **Challenge**: Preventing race conditions during inventory updates.
- **Solution**: Used Prisma's transaction capabilities with proper validation to ensure consistent stock updates.

### 4. Payment Integration
- **Challenge**: Creating a realistic payment flow without actual payment providers.
- **Solution**: Implemented a simulation mechanism that can be easily replaced with real payment processing later.

## Next Steps

1. Collect performance metrics for the baseline checkout implementation
2. Implement Redis-based caching for frequently accessed order data
3. Add order history caching for improved performance
4. Measure performance improvements after Redis integration
5. Document findings and optimization recommendations
