# Repository Unit Test Expansion

## Decisions Made:
1. **Testing Coverage Enhancement**:
   - Expanded unit test coverage to include all repository classes
   - Added comprehensive test suites for CategoryRepository and BrandRepository
   - Implemented consistent testing patterns across all repository tests
   - Used consistent mocking strategies to ensure test isolation

2. **Testing Approach Refinements**:
   - Standardized mock structure for Prisma client across repository tests
   - Implemented test cases for specialized repository methods
   - Added tests for relation-based queries (e.g., findByIdWithProducts)
   - Ensured proper error handling and edge case coverage

3. **Technical Details**:
   - Used Jest's mock system to simulate Prisma client behavior
   - Applied proper TypeScript typing to enhance mock type safety
   - Structured tests to verify both method behavior and Prisma client interaction
   - Implemented proper test lifecycle with beforeEach hooks for test isolation

4. **Best Practices Applied**:
   - Implemented AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern consistently in all tests
   - Used precise expectations to verify both data and behavior
   - Organized test files to mirror the structure of the repository implementation
   - Added appropriate test descriptions for better test documentation
