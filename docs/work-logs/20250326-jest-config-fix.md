# Jest Test Configuration Fix

## Issues Resolved:
1. **Jest Hanging Issue**: Fixed a problem where Jest wouldn't exit after test completion due to open server connections.
   - Modified test setup to properly start and close the Express server during testing
   - Implemented `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks in integration tests to handle server lifecycle
   - Ensured clean server process termination after test execution
   - Separated the Express app from the server instance in the application code for better testability

## Technical Details:
- Server now only starts automatically when the index.ts file is run directly (not when imported)
- Integration tests explicitly create and close server instances using the following pattern:
  ```typescript
  beforeAll(() => {
    server = app.listen(testPort);
  });

  afterAll((done) => {
    server.close(done);
  });
  ```
