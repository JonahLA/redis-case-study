# Product Detail API Implementation

## Decisions Made:
1. **API Structure**:
   - Created a dedicated endpoint for retrieving detailed product information
   - Implemented related products functionality to suggest similar items
   - Used consistent response structure for product details
   - Followed REST best practices for endpoint design and HTTP status codes

2. **Repository Enhancement**:
   - Extended ProductRepository with a new method for finding related products
   - Leveraged existing findByIdWithRelations method to fetch product details
   - Used efficient queries to minimize database round-trips
   - Applied selective field retrieval for related products to optimize payload size

3. **Response Formatting**:
   - Created a structured ProductDetailResponse interface for consistent typing
   - Included all required fields as specified in the API contract
   - Formatted decimal values as strings to prevent JSON precision issues
   - Implemented proper ISO date formatting for timestamp fields

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Used the existing AppError class for consistent error responses
   - Added validation for product ID parameter to prevent invalid requests
   - Implemented proper 404 handling for non-existent products
   - Ensured all error scenarios return appropriate status codes

## Technical Details:
- Implemented ProductController with endpoints for fetching product details
- Created ProductService to encapsulate business logic and repository interactions
- Added new findRelatedProducts method to ProductRepository for related product suggestions
- Set up proper request parameter validation to ensure valid product IDs
- Used try/catch blocks with next(error) pattern for consistent error handling
- Created a typed interface for the product detail response structure

## Implementation Challenges:
1. **Related Products Selection**:
   - Solution: Implemented a query to find products in the same category excluding the current product
   - Limited the number of related products to prevent large payloads
   - Ensured proper field selection to return only necessary data

2. **Type Safety with Prisma Relations**:
   - Solution: Used Prisma's generated types with explicit includes for proper TypeScript integration
   - Created a dedicated response interface to ensure type consistency
   - Applied proper type assertions where needed for TypeScript compiler

3. **Consistent Response Structure**:
   - Solution: Created a dedicated interface that matches the API contract
   - Used explicit mapping for fields requiring format changes (e.g., price to string)
   - Ensured null handling for optional fields like imageUrl
