# Redis Caching Infrastructure Implementation

## Decisions Made:
1. **Redis Client Library Selection**:
   - Selected ioredis over node-redis for its robust feature set, better TypeScript support, and built-in connection management
   - Considered the following factors:
     - ioredis provides automatic reconnection handling with customizable strategies
     - ioredis has more comprehensive TypeScript typings
     - ioredis includes Lua scripting support for future advanced caching patterns
     - ioredis offers built-in support for Redis Cluster if we need to scale later

2. **Redis Monitoring Tool Selection**:
   - Chose Redis Commander over RedisInsight for monitoring:
     - Redis Commander is lighter weight and requires fewer resources
     - Redis Commander has a simpler web interface for basic monitoring needs
     - Redis Commander is easier to containerize and integrate with Docker Compose
     - RedisInsight has more advanced analytics but is overkill for our current needs

3. **Caching Strategy Implementation**:
   - Created a singleton pattern for Redis client to prevent connection leaks
   - Implemented helper methods focused on core Redis operations with proper error handling
   - Designed cache keys with prefixes for better organization (e.g., `product:123` and `products:category:1`)
   - Added cache invalidation mechanism to maintain consistency with database updates
   - Created utility methods for common caching patterns (get-or-set, set-with-expiry)

4. **Error Handling Approach**:
   - Implemented graceful degradation - application falls back to database when Redis encounters errors
   - Added comprehensive error logging to track Redis connection and operation issues
   - Created a reconnection strategy with exponential backoff (capped at 30 seconds)
   - Set up proper Redis client event listeners to monitor connection status

5. **Integration with Health Check System**:
   - Extended the existing health check endpoint to include Redis connection status
   - Implemented a Redis ping check to verify actual connectivity
   - Enhanced the health system to report overall system health based on all service dependencies
   - Provided detailed service-specific status information in health check responses

6. **Sample Caching Implementation**:
   - Implemented caching for product retrieval operations as a practical example
   - Used TTL-based caching with 1-hour default expiration for product data
   - Created cache invalidation logic to handle product updates
   - Implemented cascading cache invalidation for related objects (e.g., clearing category caches when product changes)
   - Added proper JSON serialization/deserialization for complex objects

7. **Security Considerations**:
   - Configured Redis connection to use environment variables for all sensitive information
   - Implemented connection URLs support for flexible deployment options
   - Added sanitization for cache keys to prevent potential injection issues
   - Ensured Docker network isolation for Redis service

8. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Created a comprehensive suite of unit tests for Redis service functionality
   - Implemented Redis client mocking for consistent test results
   - Updated integration tests to verify Redis health check integration
   - Added thorough validation of error handling scenarios
