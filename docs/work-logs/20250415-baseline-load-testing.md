# Baseline Load Testing Implementation

## Date
April 15, 2025

## Overview
Today I began implementing baseline load testing for our e-commerce API endpoints. This implementation aims to establish performance metrics before Redis caching implementation, focusing on both read and write operations under high load conditions.

## Decisions Made

### 1. Load Testing Tool Selection
- **Decision**: Used k6 for load testing due to its JavaScript support and robust features
- **Rationale**: k6 provides excellent TypeScript support and detailed metrics collection
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Installed k6 via winget package manager
  - Created dedicated load testing directory structure
  - Implemented test configuration and cleanup scripts

### 2. Test Data Strategy
- **Decision**: Implemented product detail tests using dynamic product IDs
- **Rationale**: Testing with random product IDs ensures even distribution of requests
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Created product IDs range from 1-100
  - Added proper validation for response data structure
  - Implemented error handling for non-existent products

### 3. Load Test Configuration
- **Decision**: Configured multi-stage load tests to simulate realistic traffic patterns
- **Rationale**: Gradual ramp-up helps identify performance degradation points
- **Implementation Details**:
  - 30s ramp-up to 100 users
  - 1m sustained load at 2,000 users
  - 30s ramp-down to 0 users

### 4. Performance Thresholds
- **Decision**: Set specific performance thresholds for monitoring
- **Rationale**: Clear metrics help quantify Redis caching benefits later
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Response time: p95 < 1000ms
  - Error rate: < 1%
  - Added HTTP response validation

## Initial Findings

### 1. Test Infrastructure Issues
- **Issue**: High failure rate (100%) in initial product detail test run
- **Root Cause**: Test failures due to:
  1. Connection errors suggesting potential server capacity issues
  2. TypeError when accessing product.id from undefined responses
  3. Missing product data in database

### 2. Performance Metrics
- **Current State**:
  - 95th percentile response time: 37.56s (far above target of 1s)
  - Error rate: 100% (above target of < 1%)
  - Average response time: 9.61s
  - Request rate: ~91.58 requests/second

### 3. Database State
- **Finding**: Database appears to be empty or not properly seeded
- **Impact**: Causing "Cannot read property 'id' of undefined" errors
- **Next Step**: Need to run Prisma seed script to populate test data

## Next Steps

1. Run database seeding script to populate test data
2. Verify product data exists and is accessible
3. Re-run load tests with populated database
4. Analyze results with proper data
5. Document performance metrics for Redis comparison
