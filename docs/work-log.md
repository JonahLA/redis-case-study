# Work Log

## March 26, 2025 - Backend Architecture Setup

### Decisions Made:
1. **Project Structure**: Implemented a layered architecture with the following components:
   - Controller Layer: Handles HTTP requests and responses
   - Service Layer: Contains business logic
   - Repository Layer: Handles data access
   - Model Layer: Defines data structures
   - Middleware Layer: Contains cross-cutting concerns
   - Config Layer: Application configuration
   - Utils Layer: Utility functions

2. **Technology Choices**:
   - Node.js with Express for the web server
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Jest and Supertest for testing
   - ts-node-dev for development server

3. **Server Configuration**:
   - Server running on port 7090
   - Basic health check endpoint implemented at GET /health
   - Error handling middleware for consistent error responses

4. **Testing Approach**:
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Jest configured for TypeScript support

## March 26, 2025 - Jest Test Configuration Fix

### Issues Resolved:
1. **Jest Hanging Issue**: Fixed a problem where Jest wouldn't exit after test completion due to open server connections.
   - Modified test setup to properly start and close the Express server during testing
   - Implemented `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks in integration tests to handle server lifecycle
   - Ensured clean server process termination after test execution
   - Separated the Express app from the server instance in the application code for better testability

### Technical Details:
- Server now only starts automatically when the index.ts file is run directly (not when imported)
- Integration tests explicitly create and close server instances using the following pattern:
  ```typescript
  beforeAll(() => {
    server = app.listen(testPort);
  });

  afterAll((done) => {
    server.close(done);
  });
  ```

## March 26, 2025 - Docker Containerization Setup

### Decisions Made:
1. **Docker Configuration**:
   - Created a multi-container environment with Docker Compose
   - Set up three services: Node.js application, PostgreSQL, and Redis
   - Used separate Dockerfiles for development and production environments
   - Implemented service health checks to ensure dependencies are ready before the app starts

2. **Technology Choices**:
   - Node.js 18 Alpine as the base image for smaller container size
   - PostgreSQL 14 Alpine for the database
   - Redis 7 Alpine for caching
   - Docker Compose 3.8 for orchestration

3. **Development Workflow**:
   - Configured volume mounts to enable hot-reloading of code changes
   - Set up environment variables through Docker Compose
   - Created a wait-for script to handle service startup dependencies
   - Implemented separate Docker Compose configurations for development and testing

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Used environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Created .env.example with placeholder values
   - Implemented isolated networks for container communication

5. **Data Persistence**:
   - Configured named volumes for PostgreSQL and Redis data
   - Ensured data persists between container restarts
