# Work Log

## March 26, 2025 - Backend Architecture Setup

### Decisions Made:
1. **Project Structure**: Implemented a layered architecture with the following components:
   - Controller Layer: Handles HTTP requests and responses
   - Service Layer: Contains business logic
   - Repository Layer: Handles data access
   - Model Layer: Defines data structures
   - Middleware Layer: Contains cross-cutting concerns
   - Config Layer: Application configuration
   - Utils Layer: Utility functions

2. **Technology Choices**:
   - Node.js with Express for the web server
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Jest and Supertest for testing
   - ts-node-dev for development server

3. **Server Configuration**:
   - Server running on port 7090
   - Basic health check endpoint implemented at GET /health
   - Error handling middleware for consistent error responses

4. **Testing Approach**:
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Jest configured for TypeScript support

## March 26, 2025 - Jest Test Configuration Fix

### Issues Resolved:
1. **Jest Hanging Issue**: Fixed a problem where Jest wouldn't exit after test completion due to open server connections.
   - Modified test setup to properly start and close the Express server during testing
   - Implemented `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks in integration tests to handle server lifecycle
   - Ensured clean server process termination after test execution
   - Separated the Express app from the server instance in the application code for better testability

### Technical Details:
- Server now only starts automatically when the index.ts file is run directly (not when imported)
- Integration tests explicitly create and close server instances using the following pattern:
  ```typescript
  beforeAll(() => {
    server = app.listen(testPort);
  });

  afterAll((done) => {
    server.close(done);
  });
  ```
