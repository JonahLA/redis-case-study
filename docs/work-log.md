# Work Log

## March 26, 2025 - Backend Architecture Setup

### Decisions Made:
1. **Project Structure**: Implemented a layered architecture with the following components:
   - Controller Layer: Handles HTTP requests and responses
   - Service Layer: Contains business logic
   - Repository Layer: Handles data access
   - Model Layer: Defines data structures
   - Middleware Layer: Contains cross-cutting concerns
   - Config Layer: Application configuration
   - Utils Layer: Utility functions

2. **Technology Choices**:
   - Node.js with Express for the web server
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Jest and Supertest for testing
   - ts-node-dev for development server

3. **Server Configuration**:
   - Server running on port 7090
   - Basic health check endpoint implemented at GET /health
   - Error handling middleware for consistent error responses

4. **Testing Approach**:
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Jest configured for TypeScript support

## March 26, 2025 - Jest Test Configuration Fix

### Issues Resolved:
1. **Jest Hanging Issue**: Fixed a problem where Jest wouldn't exit after test completion due to open server connections.
   - Modified test setup to properly start and close the Express server during testing
   - Implemented `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks in integration tests to handle server lifecycle
   - Ensured clean server process termination after test execution
   - Separated the Express app from the server instance in the application code for better testability

### Technical Details:
- Server now only starts automatically when the index.ts file is run directly (not when imported)
- Integration tests explicitly create and close server instances using the following pattern:
  ```typescript
  beforeAll(() => {
    server = app.listen(testPort);
  });

  afterAll((done) => {
    server.close(done);
  });
  ```

## March 26, 2025 - Docker Containerization Setup

### Decisions Made:
1. **Docker Configuration**:
   - Created a multi-container environment with Docker Compose
   - Set up three services: Node.js application, PostgreSQL, and Redis
   - Used separate Dockerfiles for development and production environments
   - Implemented service health checks to ensure dependencies are ready before the app starts

2. **Technology Choices**:
   - Node.js 18 Alpine as the base image for smaller container size
   - PostgreSQL 14 Alpine for the database
   - Redis 7 Alpine for caching
   - Docker Compose 3.8 for orchestration

3. **Development Workflow**:
   - Configured volume mounts to enable hot-reloading of code changes
   - Set up environment variables through Docker Compose
   - Created a wait-for script to handle service startup dependencies
   - Implemented separate Docker Compose configurations for development and testing

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Used environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Created .env.example with placeholder values
   - Implemented isolated networks for container communication

5. **Data Persistence**:
   - Configured named volumes for PostgreSQL and Redis data
   - Ensured data persists between container restarts

## March 26, 2025 - PostgreSQL and Prisma Database Integration

### Decisions Made:
1. **Database Schema Design**:

   - Implemented one-to-many relationships (Category-to-Products, Brand-to-Products)
   - Used auto-increment integers for primary keys for simplicity
   - Added unique constraints on name fields to prevent duplicates
   - Included created/updated timestamps for all models
   - Applied appropriate indices on foreign key fields for query performance

2. **Repository Pattern Implementation**:
   - Created a generic BaseRepository class with common CRUD operations
   - Implemented model-specific repositories extending the base repository
   - Added specialized methods for each repository (e.g., findByCategory for products)
   - Implemented transaction support for critical operations like stock updates
   - Used a simplified approach for inventory management to ensure thread safety

3. **Connection Management**:
   - Implemented a singleton pattern for the Prisma client to prevent connection leaks
   - Added graceful shutdown procedures to properly close database connections
   - Created a database health check function to verify connectivity
   - Configured separate database instances for development and testing
   - Implemented connection pooling for optimal performance

4. **Data Security and Optimization**:
   - Used parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Implemented proper error handling and logging for database operations
   - Created indices on frequently queried fields
   - Used transactions for operations requiring consistency
   - Protected against concurrent update conflicts with transaction isolation

5. **Testing Methodology**:
   - Created a separate test database configuration
   - Implemented database cleanup utilities for test isolation
   - Added unit tests for repository methods
   - Used mocking strategies for unit tests to avoid database dependencies
   - Created integration tests for testing actual database interactions
   - Implemented test data seeding for reproducible test scenarios

### Implementation Challenges:
1. **Mock vs. Real Database Testing**:
   - Chose to implement pure mock-based unit tests for repository layer
   - Configured tests to use properly typed mock Prisma client
   - Structured mocks before imports to avoid circular dependency issues
   - Implemented explicit type assertions to ensure type safety in tests

2. **Transaction Handling**:
   - Simplified the stock update logic to work within Prisma's transaction API
   - Removed explicit locking statements that aren't needed with Prisma's transaction isolation
   - Maintained appropriate business logic validation (e.g., preventing negative stock)
   - Ensured proper error propagation from transaction failures

3. **Docker Integration**:
   - Updated Docker Compose configurations to handle Prisma migrations
   - Added script commands to generate Prisma client and run migrations on container startup
   - Ensured database initialization happens before application startup
   - Added proper environment variables for different environments (dev, test)

## March 27, 2025 - Repository Unit Test Expansion

### Decisions Made:
1. **Testing Coverage Enhancement**:
   - Expanded unit test coverage to include all repository classes
   - Added comprehensive test suites for CategoryRepository and BrandRepository
   - Implemented consistent testing patterns across all repository tests
   - Used consistent mocking strategies to ensure test isolation

2. **Testing Approach Refinements**:
   - Standardized mock structure for Prisma client across repository tests
   - Implemented test cases for specialized repository methods
   - Added tests for relation-based queries (e.g., findByIdWithProducts)
   - Ensured proper error handling and edge case coverage

3. **Technical Details**:
   - Used Jest's mock system to simulate Prisma client behavior
   - Applied proper TypeScript typing to enhance mock type safety
   - Structured tests to verify both method behavior and Prisma client interaction
   - Implemented proper test lifecycle with beforeEach hooks for test isolation

4. **Best Practices Applied**:
   - Implemented AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern consistently in all tests
   - Used precise expectations to verify both data and behavior
   - Organized test files to mirror the structure of the repository implementation
   - Added appropriate test descriptions for better test documentation

## March 31, 2025 - Redis Caching Infrastructure Implementation

### Decisions Made:
1. **Redis Client Library Selection**:
   - Selected ioredis over node-redis for its robust feature set, better TypeScript support, and built-in connection management
   - Considered the following factors:
     - ioredis provides automatic reconnection handling with customizable strategies
     - ioredis has more comprehensive TypeScript typings
     - ioredis includes Lua scripting support for future advanced caching patterns
     - ioredis offers built-in support for Redis Cluster if we need to scale later

   - Added cache invalidation mechanism to maintain consistency with database updates
   - Created utility methods for common caching patterns (get-or-set, set-with-expiry)

4. **Error Handling Approach**:
   - Implemented graceful degradation - application falls back to database when Redis encounters errors
   - Added comprehensive error logging to track Redis connection and operation issues
   - Created a reconnection strategy with exponential backoff (capped at 30 seconds)
   - Set up proper Redis client event listeners to monitor connection status

5. **Integration with Health Check System**:
   - Extended the existing health check endpoint to include Redis connection status
   - Implemented a Redis ping check to verify actual connectivity
